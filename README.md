# rock-paper-scissors
Classic RPS game

This is going to be a Rock-Paper-Scissors project, initially without GUI, just the logic.  

What to learn:  
- pseudocode writing  
- figuring out ways to think about problems properly  
- writing algorithms before coding  
- problem division  
- conditionals and debugging  

What I have learned:  
- planning before coding  
- using conditionals better, e.g. checking for "draw" before checking for any other results  
- using comments mainly for later use  
- building a single part at a time, then testing it  
- using console.log() for debugging  

NOTE: In the future there will be updates to this Project - not only GUI but JS part too!  

Update Log.:  
- Chose a simple flexbox-based design, admittedly too green  
- Using shades of the same color looks nice regardless  
- Game logic took more time than I wanted it to, but realized I overthink a lot and so underthinking helped solve the issue  
- Learned the importance of scope and understood call stack better
